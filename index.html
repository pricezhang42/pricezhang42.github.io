Welcom to my blog! My name is Linpu Zhang, a second degree student in CS at UofM. I'm passionate about programming and want to be a programmer (especially a video game developer I hope). I love playing guitar, listening to rock music and watching movies in my spare time. 
<br><strong>The most important reason for writing blogs is it's a motivation to write notes, otherwise laziness would defeat us inevitably. </strong> There are various blog websites on the Internet but most of them are chaotic in layouts and full of advertisements, which makes it hard to read. Therefore, we all need an Internet space organized by ourselves, so various <strong><a href="https://github.com/pinceladasdaweb/Static-Site-Generators">Static Site Generators</a></strong> have emerged. There are so many tools we can use. I was stunned by the two-page directory of programming languages! Thanks to the dedication of Github's community, I am able to to use such a convenient and efficient tool to create my own static personal website. Besides, I want to thank GitHub and the other coding website for allowing me, as a begainner programmer, to use server for free.
