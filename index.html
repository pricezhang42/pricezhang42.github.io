Welcom to my blog! My name is Linpu Zhang, a second degree student in CS at UofM. I'm passionate about programming and hope to get a position as a software developer in the industry. In my free time, I love playing guitar, listening to rock music and watching movies. 
<br><strong>I started to write blogs this year because it's a great motivation for me to keep thinking and write notes, otherwise I would have the excuse to be lazy. </strong> There are various blog websites on the Internet but most of them are chaotic in layouts and full of advertisements, which makes it hard to read. Meanwhile they are not open-sourced. So I need an Internet space organized by myself. Fortunately, there are various <strong><a href="https://github.com/pinceladasdaweb/Static-Site-Generators">Static Site Generators</a></strong> that we can choose from. I was stunned by the two-page directory of the site generators! Thanks to the dedication of Github's community, I am able to to use such a convenient and efficient tool to create my own static personal website. Besides, I want to thank GitHub and the other coding website for allowing me, as a begainner programmer, to use server for free.
